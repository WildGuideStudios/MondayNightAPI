# Monday Night API
This repository is dedicated to the api that interfaces with the game and Monday Night services. Things like the scoreboard, store, user accounts etc. are accessed with this api.

Note: Any certificates in this repository are purely for testing purposes. Real certificates should and would never end up in a public repository right? ;)
